# WorldCup2022
Creating a sample site for world cup 2022
Creating a sample soccer responsive site to be prepared before World Cup 2022. I want to create an interactive site where I can track the progress of the world cup this year. I came across the Soccer Template and I got inspired by it. I will take it and modify it to my liking.

Written in HTML5, CSS3, and Bootstrap3

Demo: http://www.worldcup2022.tech

The goal here is to learn more front-end development as well as what bootstrap can do.
